1.  Introduction

   In a wireless multihop network, the node densities may vary
   significantly depending upon deployments/scenarios.  While there is
   some policy control possible with regards to the network size in
   terms of maximum number of devices connected, it is especially
   difficult to set a figure on what will be the maximum node density
   given a deployment.  For e.g.  A network can put an upper limit on
   max 1000 devices but it is impossible to state what the node density
   will be in this 1000 node network.  Node density refers to maximum
   number of devices connected on a single link.

   Every networked node needs to manage the neighbor entries for
   resolving MAC addresses.  Linux and other operating systems have used
   neighbor management policies which essentially are first-come, first-
   serve basis.  In case of Linux, the kernel issues a warning when the
   neighbor table overflows in which case the usual step taken is to

   tune the negighbor cache size.  With constrained nodes, this solution
   does not help.

   A neighbor cache is usually used for populating neighboring one-hop
   connected nodes information such as MAC address, link local IP
   address and other state information.  Node density has direct
   implications on the neighbor cache and in constrained network
   scenario the size of the neighbor cache will be limited.  Thus there
   are chances that a node may not be able to fit all the neighboring
   nodes in its table cache in which case it has to prioritize entries
   and thus needs a neighbor management policy.

   In this draft, we present problems related to neighbor management
   policies by considering a security-enabled multi-hop 6lo network.  We
   specifically consider RPL[RFC6550] as a routing protocol and
   PANA(EAP-PANA)[RFC5191] as a network access protocol.  For RPL, both
   the storing and non-storing mode of operations are considered.  We
   also provide a sample neighbor management policy which can be used in
   such networks with its limitations and assumptions.

   For the rest of this document consider the following topology:

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   PaC: PANA Client.  New joining node which is yet to be authenticated.

   PRE: PANA Relay Element.  An already authenticated and network joined
   node which acts as a relay element for PaCs.

   PAA: PANA Auth Agent.  Auth server which hosts the credentials
   database.  PaC will handshake with PAA to complete authentication
   procedure.

   Routing Direct Child: A directly connected node who is part of the
   routing table of the parent.  For e.g. in the sample topology above
   N5 is the routing direct child for N3.  Even though N6 and N7 may
   also be part of N3 routing table, they are not considered to be
   routing direct childs since they are not on the same hop.

   Routing Parent: In the sample topology (Figure 1), N1 and N2 are
   possible routing parents for N3.

   Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE): A neighbor entry managed on behalf of
   directly connected peer.

   This document also uses terminology described in [RFC6550] and
   [RFC6775].

2.  Neighbor Management

2.1.  Significance of Neighbor management policy

   Multihop mesh networks present unique challenges to neighbor
   management especially with resource constrained nodes.  In cases
   where the node density is higher that the neighbor cache size, the
   entries have to be prioritized. [woo_et_al] and [Dawans_et_al] talk
   about prioritization of neighbor entries by using link quality
   estimation techniques.  But prioritization alone may not necessarily
   be optimal in all cases.  The reason or function why neighbor entry
   was added also needs to be taken in consideration.  For example,
   evicting a routing direct child might have a ripple effect in turn
   impacting all the sub-childs as well.

   In case of key management protocols deployed above MAC layer in
   multihop network, the neighbor management kicks in early even before
   the routing adjacencies are established.  Since a new joining node
   needs to discover/attach to a relay element for completing its
   authentication procedure, the neighbor table entries have to be
   appropriately populated both on a PaC and on the PRE.  If a neighbor
   entry whose authentication is in progress is evicted, it may increase
   the authentication time drastically.

   Another important consideration is that with increased node density,
   the prioritization based on link estimation parameters might not help
   since there might be more number of well connected peers.  In dense
   deployments the number of directly attached neighbors with good
   quality links might still be higher than the max entries in neighbor
   cache size.

2.2.  Trivial neighbor management policies

   Every networked node needs to be manage the neighbor entries for
   resolving MAC addresses.  Linux and other operating systems have used
   neighbor management policies which essentially are first-come, first-
   serve basis.  In case of Linux, the kernel issues a warning when the
   neighbor table overflows in which case the usual step taken is to
   tune the negighbor cache size.  With constrained nodes, this solution
   does not help.

   2.  LRU policy

   How it works?  Problems with these policies.

2.3.  Lifecycle of a neighbor entry

2.3.1.  Insertion

   Cases where nbr entry is added:

   PAC_Pre-auth: PaC node needs to add PRE node's neighbor entry

   PRE_Pre-auth: PRE node needs to add PaC nodes neighbor entry

   RPL-Parent:

   RPL-Direct child:

   Runtime using NS/NA

2.3.2.  Eviction

   faster eviction of unwanted entries Post authentication, the new
   joining node may not necessarily select the same relay element as a
   parent node.  In such cases, it is better to evict Parent switching
   can be a cause lot of unwanted entries.  Require optimized route
   invalidation.  Impact of direct child eviction

2.3.3.  Reinforcement

   talk about how to maintain entry freshness, estimation parameters etc

   Sample mechanism employed by Contiki for link estimation and
   reinforcement.

   Role of link estimation techniques to prioritize.

2.4.  Approaches to neighbor management policy

2.4.1.  Proactive Approach

   Is it possible for the child nodes to select parents according to
   their space availability?  In this case, parents need to advertise
   the free space availability.  This is a complex scheme ...blah blah

2.4.2.  Reactive Approach

   Nodes try to join and then fail if space is not available.  Easier to
   implement, more deterministic ... blah

2.5.  Requirements of a good neighbor management policy

   a.  Easy to implement

   b.  Less control overhead

   c.  stability of paths, deterministic routes

   d.  blah

   blahblah.

3.  Reservation based Neighbor Management Policy

   Reservation for direct childs and pre-auth entries.  Parent nodes can
   still occupy the reserved entries since they could be evicted if
   necessary.  Describe the actual policy here.

     <- - - - - - - - - - - Routing Parents - - - - - - - - - - - - ->

   Show various fields of neighbor table, routing table and their
   relation.  Explain newly added fields such as Reason field.  Storing
   mode table mapping: Non-storing mode table mapping:

3.2.  Failure handling

   How to handle DAO rejection when NBR table is full?

   How to handle PANA rejection when NBR table is full?

   How to handle NS rejection when NBR table is full?  What does
   6Lowpan-ND say in the context?

3.3.  Limitations of such a policy

   May result in sub-optimal paths.

   Certain scenarios where node density is not high enough, it may
   result in some nodes getting starved i.e. never able to get any free
   slot and thus never able to join.

Abstract

   This document describes the problems associated with neighbor
   management in multihop networks and a sample neighbor management

1.  Introduction

   In a wireless multihop network, the node densities may vary
   significantly depending upon deployments/scenarios.  While there is
   some policy control possible with regards to the network size in
   terms of maximum number of devices connected, it is especially
   difficult to set a figure on what will be the maximum node density
   given a deployment.  For e.g.  A network can put an upper limit on
   max 1000 devices but it is impossible to state what the node density
   will be in this 1000 node network.  Node density refers to maximum
   number of devices connected on a single link.

   A neighbor cache is usually used for populating neighboring one-hop
   connected nodes information such as MAC address, link local IP
   address and other state information.  Node density has direct
   implications on the neighbor cache and in constrained network
   scenario the size of the neighbor cache will be limited.  Thus there

   are chances that a node may not be able to fit all the neighboring
   nodes in its table cache in which case it has to prioritize entries
   and thus needs a neighbor management policy.

   In this draft, we present problems related to neighbor management
   policies by considering a security-enabled multi-hop 6lo network.  We
   specifically consider RPL[RFC6550] as a routing protocol and
   PANA(EAP-PANA)[RFC5191] as a network access protocol.  For RPL, both
   the storing and non-storing mode of operations are considered.  We
   also provide a sample neighbor management policy which can be used in
   such networks with its limitations/assumptions.

   For the rest of this document consider the following topology:

1.1.  Requirements Language and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   PaC: PANA Client

   PRE: PANA Relay Element

   PAA: PANA Auth Agent

   Routing Direct Child:

   Routing Parent:

   Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE)

   This document also uses terminology described in [RFC6550].

2.  Neighbor Management

2.1.  Significance of Neighbor management policy

   Multihop mesh networks present unique challenges to neighbor
   management especially with resource constrained nodes.  In class A
   devices for e.g. telos motes maximum x nodes can be provisioned as
   neighbors.

   In case of key management protocols deployed above MAC layer in
   multihop network, the neighbor management kicks in early even before
   the routing adjacencies are established.  Since a new joining node
   needs to discover/attach to a relay element for completing its
   authentication procedure, the neighbor table entries have to be
   appropriately populated both on a PaC and on the PRE.

   Link estimation alone won't help since in dense deployments the
   number of directly attached neighbors with good quality links might
   still be higher than the max entries in nbr cache.

2.2.  Trivial neighbor management policies

   1.  FCFS policy

   2.  LRU policy

   How it works?  Problems with these policies.

Internet-Draft   Neighbor Management Policy for 6LoWPAN    December 2016


2.3.  Lifecycle of a neighbor entry

2.3.1.  Insertion

   Cases where nbr entry is added:

   PAC_Pre-auth: PaC node needs to add PRE node's neighbor entry

   PRE_Pre-auth: PRE node needs to add PaC nodes neighbor entry

   RPL-Parent:

   RPL-Direct child:

   Runtime using NS/NA

2.3.2.  Eviction

   faster eviction of unwanted entries Post authentication, the new
   joining node may not necessarily select the same relay element as a
   parent node.  In such cases, it is better to evict Parent switching
   can be a cause lot of unwanted entries.  Require optimized route
   invalidation.  Impact of direct child eviction

2.3.3.  Reinforcement

   talk about how to maintain entry freshness, estimation parameters etc

   Sample mechanism employed by Contiki for link estimation and
   reinforcement.

   Role of link estimation techniques to prioritize.

2.4.  Approaches to neighbor management policy

2.4.1.  Proactive Approach

   Is it possible for the child nodes to select parents according to
   their space availability?  In this case, parents need to advertise
   the free space availability.  This is a complex scheme ...blah blah

2.4.2.  Reactive Approach

   Nodes try to join and then fail if space is not available.  Easier to
   implement, more deterministic ... blah

2.5.  Requirements of a good neighbor management policy

   a.  Easy to implement

   b.  Less control overhead

   c.  stability of paths, deterministic routes

   d.  blah

   blahblah.

3.  Reservation based Neighbor Management Policy

   Reservation for direct childs and pre-auth entries.  Parent nodes can
   still occupy the reserved entries since they could be evicted if
   necessary.  Describe the actual policy here.

     <- - - - - - - - - - - Routing Parents - - - - - - - - - - - - ->
     +----------------------+----------------------------------------+
     |                      |                              |         |
     +----------------------+------------------------------+---------+
       Routing Direct-Child                                  Pre-Auth

                Reservation for neighbors based on function

                                 Figure 2

3.1.  Updates in table structures

   Show various fields of neighbor table, routing table and their
   relation.  Explain newly added fields such as Reason field.  Storing
   mode table mapping: Non-storing mode table mapping:

3.2.  Failure handling

   How to handle DAO rejection when NBR table is full?

   How to handle PANA rejection when NBR table is full?

   How to handle NS rejection when NBR table is full?  What does
   6Lowpan-ND say in the context?

3.3.  Limitations of such a policy

   May result in sub-optimal paths.

   Certain scenarios where node density is not high enough, it may
   result in some nodes getting starved i.e. never able to get any free
   slot and thus never able to join.

   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
   for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

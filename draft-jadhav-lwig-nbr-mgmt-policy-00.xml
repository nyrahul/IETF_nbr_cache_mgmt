    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the problems associated with neighbor management in constrained multihop networks and a sample neighbor management policy to deal with it.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t> In a wireless multihop network, the node densities (maximum
   number devices connected on a single link) may vary
   significantly depending upon deployments/scenarios. While there is
   some policy control possible with regards to the network size in
   terms of maximum number of devices connected, it is especially
   difficult to set a figure on what will be the maximum node density
   given a deployment. For e.g. A network can put an upper limit on  max
   1000 devices but it is impossible to state what the node density will
   be in this 1000 node network. </t>

   <t>Every networked node needs to manage the neighbor entries for 
   resolving MAC addresses. Linux and other operating systems have used 
   neighbor management policies which essentially are first-come, 
   first-serve basis. In case of Linux, the kernel issues a warning 
   when the neighbor table overflows in which case the usual step taken 
   is to tune the negighbor cache size. With constrained nodes, this 
   solution does not help.</t>
     <!-- SD: Does Linux really has the same problem? Doesn't dynamic
     memory allocation basically solve everything? -->
   
   <t>A neighbor cache is usually used for populating neighboring
   one-hop connected nodes information such as MAC address, link local
   IP address and other state information. Node density has direct
   implications on the neighbor cache and in constrained network
   scenario the size of the neighbor cache will be limited. Thus there
   are chances that a node may not be able to fit all the neighboring
   nodes in its table cache in which case it has to prioritize entries
   and thus needs a neighbor management policy.</t>

   <t>In this draft, we present problems related to neighbor management
   policies by considering a security-enabled multi-hop 6lo 
   network. We specifically consider RPL<xref target="RFC6550"></xref> 
   as a routing protocol and PANA (EAP-PANA)<xref target="RFC5191"></xref> 
   as a network access protocol. For RPL, both the storing and non-storing 
   mode of operations are considered. We also provide a sample neighbor 
   management policy which can be used in such networks with its 
   limitations and assumptions.</t>

        <section title="Significance of Neighbor management policy">
            <t>Multihop mesh networks present unique challenges to neighbor management especially with resource constrained nodes. In cases where the node density is higher that the neighbor cache size, the entries have to be prioritized. <xref target="Woo_et_al"/> and <xref target="Dawans_et_al"/> talk about prioritization of neighbor entries by using link quality estimation techniques. But prioritization alone may not necessarily be optimal in all cases. The reason or function why neighbor entry was added also needs to be taken in consideration. For example, evicting a routing direct child might have a ripple effect in turn impacting all the sub-childs as well.</t>

            <t>In case of key management protocols deployed above MAC layer in multihop network, the neighbor management kicks in early even before the routing adjacencies are established. Since a new joining node needs to discover/attach to a relay element for completing its authentication procedure, the neighbor table entries
<!-- SD: consistency: do we make any difference between "neighbor table" and "neighbor cache"? -->
            have to be appropriately populated both on a PaC and on the PRE. If a neighbor entry whose authentication is in progress is evicted, it may increase the authentication time drastically.</t>

            <t>Another important consideration is that with increased node density, the prioritization based on link estimation parameters might not help since there might be more well connected peers. In dense deployments the number of directly attached neighbors with good quality links might still be higher than the max entries in neighbor cache size.</t>
